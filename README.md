# Smart Bottle (Arduino Project)
## 📌 Overview

This project is an embedded system implemented with Arduino (C++), designed as a Smart Bottle that monitors water temperature and water level, while providing real-time visual feedback through an LCD screen and LED indicators.

## ⚙️ Features

Temperature Monitoring:

A temperature sensor continuously measures the water temperature.

Displayed on the LCD screen.

LED strip below the bottle changes color:

🔴 Red → Hot water

🔵 Blue → Cold water

🟢 Green → Lukewarm water

Water Level Detection:

An ultrasonic distance sensor detects the water level.

The LCD shows a visual diagram of how full the bottle is.

Visual & Interactive Feedback:

Clear, user-friendly interface with dynamic updates.

Real-time LED indicators make the bottle both useful and aesthetically engaging.
